# footagefiles

This repo is used for 
  the raw footage (if not too big, otherwise they are stored on other free servers or in OneDrive), 
  .blend-Files, used for Animation, and eventually texture files
  the files produced by the Editing Software (if not too big)
  
If the files are too big, they will be stored on other servers, but Links will be provided in this repository for the ease of access.
